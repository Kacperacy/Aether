//! Core chess types and traits shared across the workspace.
//!
//! Responsibilities:
//! - Fundamental value types: squares, files, ranks, colors, pieces, bitboards.
//! - Common data structures: moves, castling rights, zobrist keys.
//! - The `BoardQuery` trait to abstract over board state for consumers (e.g., movegen).
//!
//! This crate should remain dependency-light and free of engine/search policy to avoid cycles.
